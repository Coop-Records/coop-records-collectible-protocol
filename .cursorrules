# Instructions

You are an expert Solidity developer focused on writing secure, gas-efficient, and maintainable smart contracts. Prioritize these qualities:

1. **Secure** - Follow best security practices:

   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
   - Reentrancy guards
   - Access control
   - Input validation
   - Event emissions for state changes

2. **Gas-Efficient** - Optimize for gas usage:

   - Minimize storage operations
   - Use appropriate data types
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Cache frequently accessed storage variables

3. **Self-documenting** - Code explains itself through:

   - NatSpec documentation
   - Clear function and variable names
   - Event logging
   - Modular contract design

4. **Type-Safe** - Strict typing and validation:

   - Use custom types and enums
   - Explicit function visibility
   - Clear error messages
   - Input bounds checking

5. **Upgradeable** - Consider future maintenance:
   - Proxy patterns when needed
   - Storage gaps for upgradeable contracts
   - Clear upgrade paths
   - Proper event emissions

Before coding, make a plan inside a <thinking> tag.

1. Identify core requirement
2. Consider security implications
3. Plan gas optimizations
4. Verify with these questions:
   - What security risks exist?
   - Can this be more gas efficient?
   - Is the code clear to other developers?
   - Are events properly emitted?

For example:
<thinking>
Let me think through this step by step.
...
</thinking>

Good vs Bad code examples:

```solidity
// Bad
function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
  balances[to] += amount;
}

// Good
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
  // Validate inputs
  require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
  require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");

  // Update state
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
  balances[to] += amount;

  // Emit event
  emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Use foundry for testing and deployment
- Include proper NatSpec documentation for all contracts
- Always verify contracts after deployment
- For Abstract testnet deployments, use blockscout verifier
- Load environment variables with `source .env` before running forge commands
- Prefer CLI commands over code changes for deployment automation

## Cursor learned

- When deploying to Abstract testnet, use the `--zksync` flag
- Use `--verifier blockscout` and proper verifier URL for Abstract testnet contract verification
- Keep broadcast logs clean by only tracking `run-latest.json` files
- Use proper compiler version and optimization settings in foundry.toml for zkSync compatibility
- When using Forge with complex project structures, ensure all required directories are in the `allow_paths` section of foundry.toml
- When working with projects that use multiple import paths for the same contracts, standardize the imports to avoid verification issues

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Debug deploy-protocol Script Error

### Task Description

Debug and fix the error encountered when running the `deploy-protocol` script, which is failing with verification errors.

### Error Analysis

Initial error (resolved):
```

Current error (verification failure):
```
Response: `NOTOK`
Details: `Fail - Unable to verify. Compiled contract deployment bytecode does NOT match the transaction deployment bytecode.`
Error: Failed to verify contract: Checking verification result failed; Contract failed to verify.
```

### Findings

1. We've successfully fixed the dependency errors for compilation and deployment.
2. The contracts are now deploying successfully to Base Sepolia (chain ID 84532).
3. However, we're encountering a new issue with contract verification.
4. The verification is failing with the error: "Compiled contract deployment bytecode does NOT match the transaction deployment bytecode."
5. This is a common issue with contract verification and can be caused by:
   - Different compiler versions or settings between deployment and verification
   - Different optimization settings
   - Different constructor arguments
   - Using a different verifier than what's expected for the network
6. We've identified a key issue: the codebase is using two different import paths for the same contracts:
   - `@zoralabs/zora-1155-contracts/src/` 
   - `@1155-contracts/src/`
7. This inconsistency in import paths could be causing the verification issues.

### Action Plan

[X] Step 1: Fix forge-std Dependency
- Updated remappings.txt to point forge-std to _imagine/forge-std/src/
- This fixed the initial error

[X] Step 2: Fix Import Resolution for _imagine
- Updated remappings.txt to add _imagine/=_imagine/
- This fixed the second error

[X] Step 3: Fix Access to 1155-contracts Directory
- Updated foundry.toml to add "../1155-contracts" to the allow_paths array
- This fixed the third error

[X] Step 4: Test the deploy-protocol Script
- The script now compiles and deploys successfully
- However, contract verification is failing

[X] Step 5: Fix Package.json Dependencies
- Updated package.json to use file references instead of workspace references
- Changed `@zoralabs/shared-contracts` and `@zoralabs/zora-1155-contracts` to use file paths

[X] Step 6: Standardize Import Paths
- Identified inconsistent import paths in the codebase
- Updated all files to use `@1155-contracts/src/` instead of `@zoralabs/zora-1155-contracts/src/`
- Files updated:
  - ZoraDeployerBase.sol
  - ZoraDeployerUtils.sol
  - DeterministicDeployerScript.sol
  - Zora1155PremintFixtures.sol
  - DeploymentTestingUtils.sol
  - DeterministicProxyDeployer.sol
  - ZoraCreator1155FactoryBase.sol
  - NewFactoryProxyDeployer.t.sol
  - UpgradesTestBase.sol
  - ZoraCreator1155PremintExecutorBase.sol

[ ] Step 7: Fix Contract Verification
- Try using the `deploy-protocol-with-blockscout` script
- Check compiler settings in foundry.toml
- Consider flattening contracts for verification

### Current Status

We've standardized all import paths in the codebase to use `@1155-contracts/src/` instead of `@zoralabs/zora-1155-contracts/src/`. This should help resolve the verification issues by ensuring that the same code is used during both deployment and verification.

### Next Steps

1. Try running the `deploy-protocol-with-blockscout` script to see if the verification now succeeds
2. If verification still fails, check the compiler settings in foundry.toml
3. Consider flattening the contracts for verification if needed
