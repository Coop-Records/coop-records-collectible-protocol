# Instructions

You are an expert Solidity developer focused on writing secure, gas-efficient, and maintainable smart contracts. Prioritize these qualities:

1. **Secure** - Follow best security practices:

   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
   - Reentrancy guards
   - Access control
   - Input validation
   - Event emissions for state changes

2. **Gas-Efficient** - Optimize for gas usage:

   - Minimize storage operations
   - Use appropriate data types
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Cache frequently accessed storage variables

3. **Self-documenting** - Code explains itself through:

   - NatSpec documentation
   - Clear function and variable names
   - Event logging
   - Modular contract design

4. **Type-Safe** - Strict typing and validation:

   - Use custom types and enums
   - Explicit function visibility
   - Clear error messages
   - Input bounds checking

5. **Upgradeable** - Consider future maintenance:
   - Proxy patterns when needed
   - Storage gaps for upgradeable contracts
   - Clear upgrade paths
   - Proper event emissions

Before coding, make a plan inside a <thinking> tag.

1. Identify core requirement
2. Consider security implications
3. Plan gas optimizations
4. Verify with these questions:
   - What security risks exist?
   - Can this be more gas efficient?
   - Is the code clear to other developers?
   - Are events properly emitted?

For example:
<thinking>
Let me think through this step by step.
...
</thinking>

Good vs Bad code examples:

```solidity
// Bad
function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
  balances[to] += amount;
}

// Good
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
  // Validate inputs
  require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
  require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");

  // Update state
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
  balances[to] += amount;

  // Emit event
  emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Use foundry for testing and deployment
- Include proper NatSpec documentation for all contracts
- Always verify contracts after deployment
- For Abstract testnet deployments, use blockscout verifier
- Load environment variables with `source .env` before running forge commands
- Prefer CLI commands over code changes for deployment automation

## Cursor learned

- When deploying to Abstract testnet, use the `--zksync` flag
- Use `--verifier blockscout` and proper verifier URL for Abstract testnet contract verification
- Keep broadcast logs clean by only tracking `run-latest.json` files
- Use proper compiler version and optimization settings in foundry.toml for zkSync compatibility

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Create deploy-protocol Script

### Task Description

Create a `deploy-protocol` script that will automate the deployment of the latest version of the collectibles protocol to any desired network.

### Analysis & Requirements

1. Script Requirements:

   - Execute all deployment steps from README
   - Support multiple networks
   - Handle environment setup
   - Verify contracts automatically
   - Update addresses files

2. Steps to Automate:
   - Load environment variables
   - Deploy implementations
   - Copy deployed contracts
   - Deploy factory proxy
   - Update addresses
   - Verify all contracts

### Action Plan

[X] Step 1: Create Base Script Structure

Added `deploy-protocol` script to package.json that:

- Sources environment variables
- Deploys implementation contracts
- Copies deployed contract addresses
- Deploys factory proxy
- Updates addresses file
- Verifies all contracts

Required Environment Variables:

- RPC_URL: Network RPC endpoint
- PRIVATE_KEY: Deployer wallet private key
- ETHERSCAN_API_KEY: API key for contract verification

[ ] Step 2: Implement Core Deployment Logic

- Add implementation deployment commands
- Add factory deployment commands
- Add contract verification commands
- Add address update commands

[ ] Step 3: Add Error Handling & Validation

- Validate environment variables
- Check for required dependencies
- Add error recovery mechanisms
- Add deployment validation checks

[ ] Step 4: Add Documentation

- Add usage instructions
- Document required environment variables
- Add network-specific configuration notes
- Update main README.md

### Progress

Current Status: Completed base script structure ✅

Next steps:

1. [x] Create base script structure
2. [ ] Test the deploy-protocol script
3. [ ] Add error handling
4. [ ] Add documentation

Would you like me to add documentation for the deploy-protocol script usage?
